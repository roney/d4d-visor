Visor for the D4D challenge commuting data over the Ivory Coast. We've used D3js for displaying some collected data using a choropleth and some other plots.

Choropleth
==========
The choropleth shows the population density over the different regions, grouped by day of the week and time slot.

Bar Plot
========
The bar chart shows the total population density grouped by day of the week and time slot.

Take a look!

If you want to see it running, clone the repo and start a local web server. For example, you can run Python's built-in server:

.. code:: bash

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &

Once this is running, go to http://localhost:8888/.
